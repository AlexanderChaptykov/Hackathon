London Business Survey 2014 - Access to finance
The 2014 London Business Survey (LBS) is an innovative survey designed by the Office for National Statistics, on behalf of the London Enterprise Panel and the GLA. The survey collected information from a representative sample of private sector businesses in London in May-July 2014. This dataset contains information on London businesses’ awareness and experience of business support available to SMEs corresponding with Section 6 of the London Business Survey 2014: Main Findings report. Information is provided on: The sources of external advice used by London businesses The topics on which external advice is sought by London businesses Business awareness and use of incubator, accelerator and co-working spaces As with any survey, the 2014 LBS is based on a sample and as such is subject to variability in the results. Care should therefore be taken in interpreting the survey findings. For all estimates, lower and upper limits of 95% confidence intervals are provided in the data files to assist with interpretation. The LBS results represent the population of business units in London. A business unit is defined as a site/workplace, which may also be a head office if the head office is in London. It will be the whole business in the case of businesses which only have one site, or part of the business in the case of multi-site firms. The results are presented by enterprise size band and industry sector.

HM Land Registry Price Paid Data 
Price Paid Data tracks the residential property sales in England and Wales that are lodged with HM Land Registry for registration.
Our price paid data tracks the residential property sales in England and Wales that are lodged with us for registration. The dataset is a reliable source of house price information and consists of more than 24 million definitive records dating back to January 1995. For more information on this dataset and what it does and doesn't include, visit https://www.gov.uk/about-the-price-paid-data
Choose from three options to select the data that best meets your requirements:
    monthly file: contains a single monthly file of the transactions received in the period from the first to the last day of the corresponding month, including any changes or deletions to previously downloaded data. The data is updated monthly and the average size of this file is 11 MB.
    single file: contains all the up to date data from 1995 to the current date. The data is updated monthly and the average size of this file is 2.86 GB.
    yearly files: contains annual files of up to date data, ranging from 1995 to the current date. Unlike the monthly files described above, yearly files are collated on the date of the transaction/deed date rather than the date that the information was lodged with HM Land Registry. The data is updated monthly and the sizes of these files range from 87 MB to 222 MB. If you are having trouble downloading any of the year files in full, they are also available as two smaller, evenly split CSV files.
We try to make sure that our public data is accurate, but cannot guarantee that it is free from errors or fit for your purpose or use. Reports are based on data collected at the time a property transaction is registered with us and will not necessarily be up to date with the most recent information.

Balance sheet analysis and farming performance 
This release presents the main results from an analysis of the profitability and resilience of farms in England using data from the Farm Business Survey. Six measures have been examined; liabilities, net worth, gearing ratios, liquidity, net interest payments as a proportion of Farm Business Income and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE). Source agency: Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Designation: Official Statistics not designated as National Statistics Language: English Alternative title: Balance sheet analysis and farming performance
The Farm Business Survey (FBS) is an annual survey providing information on the financial position and physical and economic performance of farm businesses in England. The sample of around 1,900 farm businesses covers all regions of England and all types of farming with the data being collected by face to face interview with the farmer. Results are weighted to represent the whole population of farm businesses that have at least 25 thousand Euros of standard output as recorded in the annual June Survey of Agriculture and Horticulture. In 2012 there were just over 56 thousand farm businesses meeting this criteria.
Data analysis The results from the FBS relate to farms which have a standard output of at least 25,000 Euros. Initial weights are applied to the FBS records based on the inverse sampling fraction for each design stratum (farm type by farm size). These weights are then adjusted (calibration weighting) so that they can produce unbiased estimators of a number of different target variables.
All data in this release is based on farms present in the FBS for 2010/11 to 2012/13 and that have complete returns on their assets and liabilities. Those entering or leaving the survey in this period have been excluded. This sub sample consists of around 1490 farms. The results for this subsample have been reweighted using a method that preserves marginal totals for populations according to farm type and farm size groups. As such, farm population totals for other classifications (e.g. regions) will not be in-line with results using the main FBS weights, nor will any results produced for variables derived from the rest of the FBS (e.g. farm business income).
Measures represent a three year average from 2010-2013, presented in 2012/2013 prices (uprated according to RPI inflation). This helps to stabilise the fluctuations in income that can significantly change the financial position of a farm from year to year.

Introducing the new RPIJ measure of Consumer Price Inflation
This article describes the new RPIJ measure of Consumer Price Inflation. RPIJ is a Retail Prices Index (RPI) based measure that will use a geometric (Jevons) formula in place of one type of arithmetic formula (Carli). It is being launched in response to the National Statistician's conclusion that the RPI does not meet international standards due to the use of the Carli formula in its calculation. The accompanying Excel file includes a back series for RPIJ from 1997 to 2012.

Explanations beyond exchange rates
Economic theory suggests that a country's trade balance should increase following a depreciation of its currency, due to the effect on the relative price of its exports and imports. This article examines the reaction of the UK trade balance since the substantial depreciation of sterling between Q3 2007 and Q1 2009, and explores the reasons why trends in UK trade may not have developed as would be expected given the sustained depreciation of sterling.

Changing Regional Economies 
These reports have been produced for each English region to coincide with the official launch of the new ONS Regional Statisticians teams, established in each English Government Office Region in April 2007. Each report provides a profile of the relevant region and presents a range of statistics that help to understand differences between regions. Within regions, comparisons are made between sub-regions and between rural and urban areas. Regional statistics in the context of the European Structural Funds are discussed, followed by a look-ahead at the developments in regional statistics expected as a result of the Allsopp programme, three years since the original Allsopp Report.

International Comparison of the Formula Effect Between the CPI and RPI
There are a number of differences between the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and Retail Prices Index (RPI), including their coverage, population base, commodity measurement and methods of construction. Combined, these differences have meant that, for most of its history, the CPI has been lower than the RPI. One of the main reasons to this difference is the method of construction at the lowest level, where different formulae are used in the CPI and RPI to combine individual prices. This difference is usually referred to as the formula effect. This article will investigate similar formula effects present in the inflation measures of other countries, and where necessary will attempt to explain why the magnitude of the formula effect experienced by other countries differs from that of the UK.

Volume Index of Capital Services (experimental)
Volume index of capital services (VICS) is a measure of capital input to economic production which takes account of the quality and use of the capital stock across time and different types of assets.
